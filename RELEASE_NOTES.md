## 1.9.1

* [Allows search of HKCU](https://github.com/rdotnet/rdotnet/pull/116) kindly contributed by [Tong Zhai](https://github.com/TongZhai)
* [NA handling in CharacterMatrix](https://github.com/rdotnet/rdotnet/pull/114) kindly contributed by [lrasmus](https://github.com/lrasmus)
* Fix for [Linux where R console output was not captured anymore](https://github.com/rdotnet/rdotnet/issues/131)
* Use netcoreapp3.1 for unit tests and other console applications
* Background preparation to move to .NET 5.0

## 1.9.0

* R.NET can run on all recent R versions from 3.4 onwards, including adjustments for R 4.0.x. While not extensively tested, any of the R 3.X releases should be supported. Note that on Linux only 3.5.y is supported due to a difficulty in detecting R versions on that OS.
* Workaround: The R engine overrides PATH and R_HOME if a .Renviron file is present, at least on on Windows. This led to [Default 'stats' package functions fail to load](https://github.com/rdotnet/rdotnet/issues/127)
* Change on windows: if several versions of R are installed and registered in the windows registry, the most recent is the default R engine loaded.
* Contributions by Luke Rasmussen and Kieren Johnstone are gratefully acknowledged

## 1.8.2

* Fix for [Data frame with character columns: unexpected results with R 3.5+](https://github.com/jmp75/rdotnet/issues/97). Thanks to Luke Rasmussen for this.
* R.NET can on all recent R versions from 3.4 onwards. While not extensively tested, any of the R 3.X releases should be supported. Note that on Linux only 3.5.y is supported due to a difficulty in detecting R versions on that OS.
* R.NET assemblies now target netstandard2.0 and support .NET core (2.0) and .NET framework (4.6.1+ but preferably 4.7.2 see [.NET implementation support](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/net-standard#net-implementation-support) )
* Key contributions by Luke Rasmussen, David Pendray and others are gratefully acknowledged to make this release possible

## 1.8.1

* R.NET can now also run on all recent R versions in the 3.4 and 3.5 series. While not extensively tested any of the R 3.X series should be supported. Note that on Linux only 3.5.y is supported due to a difficulty in detecting R versions on that OS.
* R.NET assemblies now target netstandard2.0 and support .NET core (2.0) and .NET framework (4.6.1+ but preferably 4.7.2 see [.NET implementation support](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/net-standard#net-implementation-support) )

## 1.6.4
* Fixed github #17 (do not crash when R_Visible is not exported).

## 1.6.3
